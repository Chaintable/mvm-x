# Chaintable write node

> Fork of [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism), with Chaintable pipeline patches.

## Architecture

This repo runs the chain's execution layer with the [Chaintable pipeline](https://github.com/Chaintable/pipeline) tracer embedded. The tracer extracts block data — block headers, transactions, call traces, receipts, events, and state diffs — and ships it to **S3 + Kafka** (see pipeline's [architecture](https://github.com/Chaintable/pipeline/blob/main/docs/architecture.md)). Two consumption paths:

- **Block headers + state diffs** → Kafka + S3 → [leafage-evm](https://github.com/Chaintable/leafage-evm): a lightweight EVM executor serving state queries (`eth_call`, `eth_estimateGas`, …), no P2P sync, no tx storage (see its [architecture](https://github.com/Chaintable/leafage-evm#architecture)).
- **Block files** (transactions · call traces · receipts · events) → S3 → Chaintable's transaction/trace indexing pipeline.
